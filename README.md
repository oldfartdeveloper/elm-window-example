# elm-window-example

A simple example showing using the
[Window package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/window/1.0.0/).

# Overview

A simple program showing how to set up using the **Window** package by
showing the window dimensions in pixels as you resize the application's
window.

I've implemented a `Main.elm` file to mimic how this would be
organized in a typical Elm program.

# Installation

Install [elm 0.17.1](http://elm-lang.org/install) if you haven't done so already.

Remaining instructions presume installing under OSX:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:oldfartdeveloper/elm-window-example.git
cd elm-window-example
elm make
elm reactor
```

Then browse **[http://localhost:8000/Main.elm](http://localhost:8000/Main.elm)**
and resize the window to your heart's content.
